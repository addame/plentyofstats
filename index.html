  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    Plenty of Stats is a project to scrape the popular internet dating site <a href='http://plentyoffish.com'>Plenty of Fish</a>
    using Ruby and why's <a href='http://github.com/why/hpricot'>Hpricot library</a>.
  </p>
  <p>  
    Using the 'number of results' Plenty of Fish provides on each search request, it's possible
    to query each age and sex and build a list of results by age and city.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started with a base search, no user attributes, to get the number of Plenty of Fish users for each gender and age 18 to 65,
    in each of the top 15 cities(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_metropolitan_area#Top_25'>according to Wikipedia</a>).
    After building the base results, I scraped for drinking, smoking, and drug use(combining 'social' and 'heavy' use).
  </p>
  <h2>Notable Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Holy shit, that's a lot of dudes!</li>
    <li>Chicago wants to know if it can bum a cigarette</li>
    <li>Oh and can you hold DC's beer while it gives Chicago a light?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Top Cities for...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Drinking: Washington D.C. - 40.72%</li>
    <li>Smoking: Chicago - 9.6%</li>
    <li>Drugs: Los Angeles - 1.24%</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gender Ratio</h2>

  <img src='images/percent_male.png' width='600'/>
  <p>I guess this is to be expected, but still a little depressing. But don't worry, the tables seem to turn at 64.</p>

  <h2>Where not to move</h2>
  <img src='images/city_gender.png' width='600' />
  <p>Ladies, meet San Francisco</p>
  
  <h2>Smoking, Drinking and Drugs</h2>
  <img src='images/sexdrugsrocknroll.png' width='600'/>
  <p>Proof that politics lead to drinking</p>
  
  <h2>US vs City of London</h2>
  <img src='images/us_avg.png' width='600' />
  <img src='images/uk_avg.png' width='600'/>
  <p>And the total average breakdown</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drinking: 83.15%</li>
    <li>Smoking: 24.43%</li>
    <li>Drugs: 1.22%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top marks on drinking and smoking, only to be beaten by LA in the drug department by .02%. Maybe next year.</p>

  <h2>The Data, and Weird Anomalies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href='http://github.com/markpercival/plentyofstats'>Download the data and the Ruby code used to scrape it on github</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Feel free to run the data through your own report and see what you get.
    You can pick up the data, in CSV and SQLite format in the github repo above.</p>
  <p>
    Obviously this data is purely for entertainment, as I had to massage some of the city data to get
    it under the 700 result limit imposed by Plenty of Fish. In the case of LA and NY, I only queried users
    which had chosen to list their height. And in London, I picked users with average body types.
    I can't figure out what's up with the drinking in Chitown, LA, NYC, and DC.
    I've checked the site by hand and confirmed the numbers. 
  </p>
  
  <p>And of course at the 55+ range the data is bollocks, since the number of users in that age range are few and far between.</p>
