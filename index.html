  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    Plenty of Stats is a project to scrape the popular internet dating site Plenty of Fish.
    Using the 'number of results' Plenty of Fish provides on each search request, it's possible
    to build a list of ages with their matching results.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started with a base search, no attributes, just the number of Plenty of Fish users for each gender, each age 18 to 65,
    in each of the top 15 cities(according to Wikipedia).
    After building the base results, I scraped for drinking, smoking, and drug use.

  <p>Below I'll highlight some '</p>
  <h2>Notable Observations</h2>

  <h2>The Data</h2>
  <p>Feel free to run the data through your own report and see what you get.
    You can pick up the data, in CSV and SQLite format on the projects github repo.
    I should note, I can't figure out what's up with the drinking in Chitown, LA, NYC, and DC.
    I've checked the numbers by hand and what can I say. Those fuckers can drink!

  <h2>Additional Info</h2>
  <p>I'm running London tonight. Word on the street is they can give Chicago a run for it's money</p>
